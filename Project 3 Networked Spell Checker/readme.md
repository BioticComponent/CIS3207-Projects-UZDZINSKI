# Networked Spell Checker

This program is a simple multi-threaded server that serves clients on a local network. The server has a predetermined amount of workers (threads) it provides. When a client connects, one worker will provide the spell checking service for it. If more clients connect than there are workers, they will be prompted to wait until a worker is available. Clients are served on a first in first out basis. Mutex locks and condition variables are used to ensure mutual exclusion and proper synchronization of access to two queues. The first queue is a list of socket descriptors of the clients and the second queue is a list of log messages from each client. These queues are both examples of the producer/consumer problem. The main thread produces client sockets, the worker threads consume them. The workers produce log messages, and a logger thread consumes these and prints them to an external log.txt file.
